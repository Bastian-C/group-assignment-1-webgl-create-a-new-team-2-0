# ECG assignment: Shader

## Task
The task is to implement a small WebGL program that renders one 3D object (either primitive (e.g. cube) or loaded from a GLTF) using some *artful* or *technically challenging* vertex/fragment shader combination.

The implementation has to be done individually and will be presented in class (max 2-3 minutes).

The code needs to be committed (pushed) into this Github classroom repository. It will be rendered on the teachers laptop (no CUDA, Win11, Firefox or Chrome or Edge).

The code needs to be explained in a short readme.

## Rating
The rating will be as follows:
- presentation and challenge: 30 % 
- arts and/or math: 40 %
- code quality: 30 %

## Explanation
Made a colorful little rocket that rotates in all axes and different radians.
The FragmentShader puts a little grid on it, which reminds me of old tube televisions, where you can see every pixel. The grid takes the horizontal and vertical coordinates and makes a black line every 5 steps.
